            <p class="ml-3 mt-2"><span class="text-xl text-bold">Ans: 



                Variables that declared with 'var' are function-scoped. This means they are visible and accessible within the function in which they are defined.
                You can reassign and redeclare a var variable within the same scope.<br>
               
              -- Variables declared with 'let' and 'const' are block-scoped. They are visible and accessible only within the block in which they are defined, such as a function, loop, or conditional statement.
               You can reassign a let variable within the same block scope, but you cannot redeclare it in the same scope. <br>
                --Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned after they are assigned a value. However, for objects and arrays declared with const, their properties or elements can be mutated, but the variable itself cannot be assigned a new value. <br>
               
               
               --the scope of var is function-level, and it is hoisted. let and const have block-level scope, and they are not hoisted. let allows reassignment, while const enforces immutability for the variable itself but allows modifications to properties or elements of objects and arrays.
               <br>
                <span class="font-bold">It's generally recommended to use 'let' and 'const' over 'var' in modern JavaScript development to avoid some common issues associated with var.</span></span></p>

            <h1 class="text-3xl text-bold">QS 2: Tell us the use cases of null and undefined.</h1>
            <p class="ml-3 mt-2"><span class="text-xl text-bold">Ans: Null is basically an assignment value. The variable which has been assigned as null contains no value and is empty. Undefined is when we declare a variable but do not assign a value to it, the variable becomes undefined. <br>
                
                ** difference between null and undefined in JavaScript. <br>
                
                -Undefined-  <br>
                1. Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned. <br>
                2. The typeof() operator returns undefined for an undefined variable. <br>
                3. It returns NaN on performing arithmetic operations.  <br>
                4. If there is no value assigned to the variable, it becomes undefined. <br>
                <br>
                -Null- <br> 
                1.  Null means an empty value or a blank value. <br>
                2. The typeof() operator returns the type as an object for a variable whose value is assigned as null. <br>
                3. converts to 0 then perform the operation <br>
                4. If we assign null to a variable, it is an assignment value. <br>
                <br>
                <span class="text-2xl">Use cases:</span>
                
                Use undefined when you want to represent the absence of a value that hasn't been assigned yet, often for variables or object properties. <br>
                Use null when you want to explicitly indicate the absence of an object or value, typically as a placeholder for an object that will be assigned later or to represent the intentional absence of a value in your code. <br>
                
                
                
                
                
                
               <span class="font-bold"> It's important to note that both null and undefined are falsy values in JavaScript, which means they evaluate to false in a Boolean context. However, they have different semantic meanings, and it's essential to use them appropriately in your code to convey your intent accurately.</span></span>

            <h1 class="text-3xl text-bold">QS 3: What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
            <p class="ml-3 mt-2"><span class="text-xl text-bold">Ans: 
                A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style. <br> <br>
               
               
               
               Some APIs, such as SOAP or XML-RPC, impose a strict framework on developers. But REST APIs can be developed using virtually any programming language and support a variety of data formats. The only requirement is that they align to the following six REST design principles - also known as architectural constraints:
               <br>
               <br>
               <span class="font-bold">1. Uniform interface.</span> All API requests for the same resource should look the same, no matter where the request comes from. The REST API should ensure that the same piece of data, such as the name or email address of a user, belongs to only one uniform resource identifier (URI). Resources shouldn’t be too large but should contain every piece of information that the client might need. <br>
               
               <span class="font-bold">2. Client-server decoupling.</span> In REST API design, client and server applications must be completely independent of each other. The only information the client application should know is the URI of the requested resource; it can't interact with the server application in any other ways. Similarly, a server application shouldn't modify the client application other than passing it to the requested data via HTTP. <br>
               
               <span class="font-bold">3. Statelessness.</span> REST APIs are stateless, meaning that each request needs to include all the information necessary for processing it. In other words, REST APIs do not require any server-side sessions. Server applications aren’t allowed to store any data related to a client request. <br>
               
              <span class="font-bold"> 4. Cacheability.</span> When possible, resources should be cacheable on the client or server side. Server responses also need to contain information about whether caching is allowed for the delivered resource. The goal is to improve performance on the client side, while increasing scalability on the server side. <br>
               
               <span class="font-bold">5. Layered system architecture.</span> In REST APIs, the calls and responses go through different layers. As a rule of thumb, don’t assume that the client and server applications connect directly to each other. There may be a number of different intermediaries in the communication loop. REST APIs need to be designed so that neither the client nor the server can tell whether it communicates with the end application or an intermediary. <br>
               
               <span class="font-bold">6. Code on demand (optional).</span> REST APIs usually send static resources, but in certain cases, responses can also contain executable code (such as Java applets). In these cases, the code should only run on-demand. <br>
               <br>
               
               
               
               
               
               
             <span class="font-bold">  RESTful APIs are widely used in web and mobile application development because for their simplicity, scalability, and compatibility with the HTTP protocol. They are commonly used for data retrieval, manipulation, and communication between client and server in a wide range of applications.</span> </span></p>
